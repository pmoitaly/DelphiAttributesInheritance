# DelphiAttributesInheritance
## _A small app to investigate the attributes behaviour across inherited classes in Delphi._

Delphi Attributes Interface is a small app I used to understand the inheritance of attributes in Delphi. I published this app to share my results with Delphi community.
It sounds like that 
- class attributes are __not__ inherited
- any member attribute __is__ inherited

I performed my test with Delphi 10.1 and Delphi 10.4. Feel free to change my code to use it in future versions too.
